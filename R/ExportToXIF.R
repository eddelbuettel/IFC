#' @title RIF/CIF File Writer
#' @description
#' Subsets or merges RIF or CIF files.
#' @param fileName path(s) of file(s) to subset or merge.
#' If multiple files are provided they will be merged. Otherwise, if only one file is input it will be subsetted.
#' All files have to be either '.rif' or '.cif' files.
#' All files should have same channels.
#' @param write_to pattern used to export file.
#' Placeholders, like "\%d/\%s_fromR.\%e", will be substituted:\cr
#' -\%d: with full path directory of first element of 'fileName'\cr
#' -\%p: with first parent directory of first element of 'fileName'\cr
#' -\%e: with extension of first element of 'fileName' (without leading .)\cr
#' -\%s: with shortname from of first element of 'fileName' (i.e. basename without extension).\cr
#' Exported file extension will be deduced from this pattern. It has to be the same as 'fileName', i.e. .cif or .rif.
#' @param objects integers, indices of objects to use. If missing, the default, all objects will be used. Only apply for subsetting.
#' @param offsets object of class `IFC_offset`. If missing, the default, offsets will be extracted from 'fileName'.\cr
#' This param is not mandatory but it may allow to save time for repeated XIF export on same file. Only apply for subsetting.
#' @param fast whether to fast extract objects or not. Default is TRUE.
#' Meaning that 'objects' will be extracting expecting that raw object are stored in ascending order.\cr
#' Note that a warning will be sent if an 'object' is found at an unexpected order.
#' In such a case you may need to rerun function with 'fast' = FALSE.
#' If set to FALSE, all raw object_ids will be scanned from 'fileName' to ensure extraction of desired 'objects'.\cr
#' IMPORTANT: whatever this argument is, features are extracted assuming an ascending order of storage in raw file.\cr
#' Only apply for subsetting.
#' @param extract_features whether to try to extract features. Default is FALSE.
#' IMPORTANT: it is not clear if how features are stored and which objects they rely to when input file is already a merge or a subset.
#' For this reason it should be carefully checked.
#' Note that features extraction is not implemented for merging.
#' @param endianness the endian-ness ("big" or "little") of the target system for the file. Default is .Platform$endian.
#' @param verbose whether to display information (use for debugging purpose). Default is FALSE.
#' @param verbosity quantity of information displayed when verbose is TRUE; 1: normal, 2: rich. Default is 1.
#' @param overwrite whether to overwrite file or not. Default is FALSE.\cr
#' Note that if TRUE, it will overwrite exported file if path(s) of file(s) in 'fileName' and deduced from 'write_to' arguments are different.
#' Otherwise, you will get an error saying that overwritting source file is not allowed.\cr
#' Note also that an original file, i.e. generated by IDEAS(R) or INSPIRE(R), will never be overwritten.
#' Otherwise, you will get an error saying that overwritting original file is not allowed.\cr
#' @param display_progress whether to display a progress bar. Default is TRUE.
#' @param ... other arguments to be passed.
#' @details when 'extract_features' is set TRUE, only features stored in binary format will be extracted if found.\cr
#' If the input 'fileName' is a merged of several files then features will be extracted from these files.\cr
#' If these files can't be found, Warning(s) will be thrown and input 'fileName' will be extracted without features values.
